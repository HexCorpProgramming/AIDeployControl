    <h3>About this page</h3>
    <p>
        This interface is intended to give the QA team control over the QA instance of the HexCorp Mxtress AI. Please
        always be aware, that there might be others currently using the AI and coordinate accordingly.
    </p>
    <h4>Launch the AI</h4>
    <p>
        Clicking this button only works, if the AI is not already running.<br>
        When you click it, the newest develop version of the AI will be loaded and launched as the QA instance.
    </p>
    <h4>Stop the AI</h4>
    <p>
        Clicking this button only works, if the AI is currently running.<br>
        When you click this button the currently launched QA instance of the AI will be stopped. It may appear to still
        be logged on to discord, but will not react to commands.
